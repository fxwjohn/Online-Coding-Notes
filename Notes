1. There will be an overflow to normal integer when the input(from file) is too large.
2. There is a segmentation fault occurred when submiting source codes, reason here is that a too large space is required from heap which exceeds the limit( int *ptr = new int(100000))
3. Bitmanipulation could not change the data itself.
